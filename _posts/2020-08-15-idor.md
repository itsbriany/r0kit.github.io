## APIs

* Create two accounts.
* Populate as much data as you can for both accounts. Make sure to make at least two instances for each model so that you can test deletion later.
* Streamline the process with Burp's `autorepeater` for this.
* Check for IDOR by computing all the remaining API functions with Burp's `autorize` extension.
* Get lucky, profit!


## Databases

* Some models may reference other models that belong to some other identity, and leak the information!
* Create visual tables so you can visualize relationships between data models.
* Prioritize investigating models that have complex relations so you can attempt to disclose indirect information from them.
